# Word-Representation

# Dataset

The dataset was randomly cralwed from the BBC Yoruba website.

# What Was Done

I created the word embedding of a random Yoruba document using FastText. The model was validated using the wordSim353 and then used to get the representations of the words and the similarity of the words using sparemanr.
